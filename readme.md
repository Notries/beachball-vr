A beach VR experience to socialize with your friends while bouncing a beach ball back and forth. Don't let the ball fall!

Developed in *Social AR/VR Studio*, a course at Northwestern University by Professor Kate Compton.

Coded on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/)

Inspired by the notion of the "third place" (see: *The Great Good Place* by Ray Oldenburg, or [this excellent Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)).
