A beach VR experience to socialize with your friends while bouncing a beach ball back and forth. Don't let the ball fall!

Developed in *Social AR/VR Studio*, a course at Northwestern University by Professor Kate Compton.

Inspired by the notion of the "third place" (see: *The Great Good Place* by Ray Oldenburg, or [this excellent Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)).

## Controls

### Computer

Click on the UI controls to change your shape and color.

Drag the mouse to look around and angle your head to hit the ball.

### Phone / Google Cardboard

Tap on the UI controls to change your shape and color.

Tap on the "VR" button in the bottom right corner and allow VR access to go into VR mode.

Put your phone in the Google Cardboard device and control your in-game avatar's head by tilting your head.
